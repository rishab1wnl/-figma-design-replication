## 🌟 Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to replicate a Figma design. It includes a structured HTML page, styled with CSS, and interactivity managed through JavaScript. The web page features a navigation bar, a video display toggle, and a popup for booking demo sessions. Data is stored in the browser's local storage for persistence.

## 🔥 Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Provides links to different sections of the website, such as Home, Programs, Success Story, and About. It includes a button to book a free demo session.
- **Video Display Toggle**: Allows users to switch between a video thumbnail and an embedded YouTube video.
- **Demo Booking Popup**: Includes a popup form for users to book a demo session.
- **Local Storage**: Data entered in the demo booking form is stored in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions.
